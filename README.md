# 🧑‍💼 IBM HR Attrition Dashboard

This project explores why employees leave a company, using IBM’s HR analytics dataset. With the help of **SQL**, **Python**, and **Power BI**, I’ve built an interactive dashboard that highlights key trends in employee attrition.

It’s designed to help HR teams and decision-makers understand what factors lead to turnover—and how to address them.
